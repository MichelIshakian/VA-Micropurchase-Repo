# General UX Practitioner Interview Notes

Formerly [Software Company], [Insurance Company], [Government Services Agency]. Since this person had a lot of experience on comparable projects, this was a very general/high level interview. After hearing about the project, we asked for recommendations in approaching building such an app at the VA, based on her experience.

## Given what you know about this type of project, what advice would you have based on your past success/failures that we could learn from?

In getting started, I would ask:

* Will you build a true app or a frame?

* What should be offline? What services will work when you aren’t online? This is an important thing to consider upfront when you map out your features, etc.

For example, when I was at [Big Insurance Company]:

* Largest auto insurance in state

* Also does property casualty

* For flood insurance -- they might not have electricity or wifi -- so using the app to file these things was frustrating or a non starter

* Are there directions/resources that don’t have connections

* There was a lot of stuff we didn’t realize they would need offline access for

**Ask yourself: when do you need an internet connection?**

In [my] world you don’t need the internet for an app and to use the functionality, that’s why it’s an app:

* Maybe for a form you need offline access

* Suicide prevention -- do they need to be talked down? If so is that a phone call? Hopefully they don’t need internet.

**If it’s an app will users need a credit card to download it?**

* App store, credit card needed to have that

* Do homeless populations w/ phones -- are they able to download apps?

**Really look at actual needs vs perceived needs:**

* Leadership didn’t understand what people would do on mobile devices, and had a lot of assumptions about what users would and wouldn’t do on a device (note: this was not super recent)

**Convenience vs. investing time in a decision:**

* If they need to think through something they will prefer a bigger screen

* Looking at a mobile device still carries a stigma

* What people are comfortable on a mobile device, might not change coverage amounts or big things w/o talking to a human; our customers were really uncomfortable with big decisions -- like changing their plan -- on a mobile device

* What are they comfortable doing on an app vs normal things

* Challenge collectively held norms -- a lot has changed in the past couple years

**For [Software Company]:**

* Filing on your phone was popular, only worked (at least at first) in a few instances

* Text messages saying what you did well -- was awesome, people loved it

* Taking a picture, uploading the file, it was magic

* Was for the [easy claims without complexity], people loved it

* We hit a sweet spot where the task was: easy to complete, low cognitive burden, complexity is low

* This might be an interesting avenue for the VA
