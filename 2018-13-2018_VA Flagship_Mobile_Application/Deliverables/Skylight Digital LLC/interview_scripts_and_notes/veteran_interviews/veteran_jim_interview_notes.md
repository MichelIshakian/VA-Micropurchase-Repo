## 7. Would you have any concerns about using an app for this? If so, what would they be.

Would be most likely to use VA services for:

Emergency visits -- went to the closest hospital, doesn’t know how long he’d wait at the VA

Getting a routine appt -- would us VA

Doctor send him snail mail for appt results

Feels fortunate and lucky that the VA has worked for him

Asheville VA: #1 VA in the country

Happy with his care

His army buddies, don’t really discuss those issues

Some have to travel far

His brother is a Veteran and also (like me) a "wirehead" (likes technology)

Refers to himself, a helicopter pilot as a "rotorhead"

Last 14 days is when people really transition into VA services out of service. Hears they are getting much better at this transition.
