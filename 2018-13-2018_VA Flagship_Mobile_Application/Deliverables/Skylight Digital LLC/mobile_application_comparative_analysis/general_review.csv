Sure, the animations are cute, but all I want to do is get to the info. :::::Previous review: Since you're forcing another review, instead of allowing an update, you got it! HUGE FAIL! Forcing updates, won't accept login until you do update. Also, paid directly from bank account and says it may take 5 days...Every other business gladly takes $$ payment from checking account immediately. Looking for more user friendly insurance company""

I love that it gives you the ability to look at paper statements. Very convenient for checking your account quickly. The only thing I don't like is the fact that you can't use a debit card (unless I missed that feature), but it's not that serious. Overall great app. Update: still using this app in November 2018, still loving it. I'll really miss using it when I finally pay my credit card off.
